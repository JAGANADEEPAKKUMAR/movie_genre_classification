# movie_genre_classification
This model predicts the genre of a movie based on the plot summary of the movie.



1)Data Collection: Gather a dataset of movies along with their plot summaries and corresponding genres. You can use sources like IMDb, Wikipedia, or specialized datasets available online.

2)Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization. You may also want to convert the text to lowercase and remove any special characters.

3)Feature Engineering: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. You can use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent each plot summary as a numerical vector.

4)Model Selection: Choose a classifier to train on the feature vectors. Options include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or even more advanced algorithms like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines.

5)Training: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train the chosen classifier on the training data.

6)Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing data. You may also want to use techniques like cross-validation for more robust evaluation.

7)Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model to optimize its performance. Techniques like grid search or randomized search can be used for this purpose.

8)Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, you can deploy it for making predictions on new unseen movie plot summaries.
